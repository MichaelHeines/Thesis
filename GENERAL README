This github page contains all of the programs I created for my master thesis in the academic year 2020-2021

The programs of the semi analytical model, the numerical recoil analysis (NRA) and the full numerical model (FNM) are provided here, as well as the analysis of the lead castle setup and the coincidence setup. Some small programs were also written for the alpha chamber analysis, but the analysis itself was performed by J.D. Johnson.

The c++ (root) files were run on the cluster, where an automatic namespace is incorporated. This convenient to use, but is generally not good practise.



DISCLAIMER: This code was written for the analysis of an experimental campaign at CERN-MEDICIS. The author cannot be held responsible for any shortcomings of the code.
